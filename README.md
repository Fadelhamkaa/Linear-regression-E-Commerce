Interpreting the findings from this analysis can be challenging. The model indicates that the most crucial factor for clients is not the time spent on the app or website, 
but rather their length of membership. Among the two predictors (desktop vs. app), the app has a significantly stronger influence. In fact, the time spent on the desktop 
website appears to show no correlation at all! This suggests that the duration a customer spends on the desktop site is nearly irrelevant to their spending habits.

We can view this situation in two ways. First, it might imply that the desktop website needs improvements to encourage visitors to make purchases. 
Alternatively, it could suggest that customers are more swayed by mobile applications of online stores compared to desktop sites. Thus, efforts could be 
better focused on leveraging this insight. Ultimately, interpreting these results requires expertise in online marketing. Nevertheless, our analysis and 
model effectively highlight the importance of the various predictors.
